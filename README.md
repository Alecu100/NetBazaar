# NetBazaar
a partially completed ecommerce website

I is built using ASP .Net MVC 5 using knockout.js for the frond end. As a database I used SQL Server and MongoDB.
To store images I used azure, in this case it is the local emular. But you can change the settings to use azure for real.\

I implemented some advanced ASP .Net concepts like custom membership using customs stores for users, roles and so on.
I also used some usefull ASP .nEt features like automatic POST mapping to plain C# objects of a json object. 

I also used formdata to transfer images from the browser to the server using ajax.
